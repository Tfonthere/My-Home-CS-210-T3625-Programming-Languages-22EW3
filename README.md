C++ work

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was the final project needed for week 7 of class cs 210. It was built to sort out a grocery list.

What did you do particularly well?

Honestly I do not think I did anything with it perticularly well. Since I still have a lot to learn concenring how to program in C++ and Python.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Honestly more time I think would have given me a lot better command of the topic matter and thereby a better more sound end program. 
Since I feel my proficiency is not that high when compaired to most of my classmates. Who have worked professionally in the coding world. Where as I am still learning how to walk. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challengining was the interface between Pyhon and C++ and that interconnectedness. Since no matter how well I followed instractions, my code would run well for one iteration, then suddently would break down irrecoverably after slight modificaiton. Forcing me to start over to attempt to get it to run correctly. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think everything I touched will be. Since I covered a lot of ground this semester,and so think I will be able to found lots of usese going forward.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

to keep it readable I commented everywhere. To keep it maintainable I made sure to save all the files applicable inside the same zipe. I kept it adaptable by using both pythong and C++ in its inner workings. Since both platforms togather bring a lot of versatility to the table.
